      "description": "Addressed two audit recommendations for the Footer component. (1) Replaced hardcoded 'Latency: 14ms' with actual page load time using Navigation Timing API (domContentLoadedEventEnd - startTime), falling back to performance.now(). Shows '--' during SSR, updates on mount. (2) Added subtle 'Press ? for shortcuts' hint (hidden on mobile via hidden sm:inline) to improve keyboard shortcuts discoverability — audit noted that <1% of visitors would discover the ? shortcut without a visible hint. Both changes are lightweight, on-brand (mono uppercase tracking-widest), and aria-hidden on the hint since it's supplementary."

Also stabilized existing baseline tests: added dynamic content freezing (footer latency counter, GitHub stats age), explicit animation disabling, and increased pixel tolerances for inherently dynamic full-page screenshots.

Applied 4 fixes: (1) RAF-gated Hero mousemove handler to prevent getBoundingClientRect() on every mousemove event — captures target/coords synchronously, defers rect calculation to next animation frame with cancellation on mouse leave. (2) RAF-gated SkillRadar tooltip hover handlers with same pattern. (3) Replaced non-standard CSS `transition: points` on SkillRadar polygon with JS-driven requestAnimationFrame interpolation (ease-out cubic, 800ms) for cross-browser compatibility — Safari/Firefox don't support CSS transitions on SVG `points` attribute. (4) Fixed critical motion store bug where `toggleAttribute('data-reduce-motion', false)` followed by `dataset.reduceMotion = 'false'` re-added the attribute, causing CSS selector `html[data-reduce-motion]` to always match and suppress ALL animations permanently. Simplified to setAttribute/removeAttribute pattern. Updated scrollReveal.ts and EngineeringLog.svelte to use `hasAttribute('data-reduce-motion')` instead of `dataset.reduceMotion === 'true'`.

Uses .dark class on <html> with FOUC-prevention blocking script in app.html. Light-mode CSS custom property overrides in app.css (warm parchment #F9F1CB backgrounds, dark text #1A1816, tan borders #C9C0A0, lichen green #4A7C59 status-ok). Accent #B80C09 unchanged across both modes. Toggle button in desktop nav (Material Symbols light_mode/dark_mode icons, border+hover styling matching animation toggle) and mobile menu (labeled row with Dark/Light indicator). Dynamic aria-label describes resulting action. Light-mode scrollbar and selection overrides included.",

(help modal), t (theme toggle), m (motion toggle), 1-7 (section navigation via scrollIntoView), h (scroll to top), Escape (close modal). Modal styled as terminal reference card (bg-surface, border-border-dim, mono font, accent-colored kbd elements). Focus trap within modal, backdrop click/Escape to close. Form-field suppression (skips input/textarea/contenteditable). Reduced-motion support (no scale animation, smooth→auto scroll). Added id='competencies' to CoreCompetencies and id='interests' to Interests sections for number-key navigation. Component: src/lib/components/ui/KeyboardShortcuts.svelte, mounted in +layout.svelte.",
